It's the default interception mechanism of NSA for both voice, PS2 and USB keyboard keypresses, exfiltered data, network traffic and any kind of data the NSA is interested to extract from a target. It's a very advanced attack where a Radar sends a [[CW]] toward a target covertly equipped with a eavesdropping bug called a [[RETROREFLECTOR]] which will modulate the original [[CW]] signal and re-radiate this modulated [[CW]] so that it can be picked up by the emitting Radar. The benefit of such technique is that there is no need for the eavesdropping bug to generate radio signal, and therefore, no need for huge batteries or power. It also means that the bug can be turned on and off remotely, providing easy way to turn off the bug when a bug sweep detection team is trying to located it. The downside is that it's dangerous for health as the Radar signal between 1Ghz and 6Ghz can be harmful to human and cause illness and cancer, as it did numerous times in the past since the first time it was detected in the US Embassy in Moscow, Russia."

Provides room audio from targeted space using radar and basic post-processing. LOUDAUTO's current design maximizes the gain of the microphone. This makes it extremely useful for picking up room audio. It can pick up speech at a standard, office volume from over 20' away. (NOTE: Concealments may reduce this distance.) It uses very little power (~15 uA at 3.0 VDC), so little, in fact, that battery self-discharge is more of an issue for serviceable lifetime than the power draw from this unit. The simplicity of the design allows the form factor to be tailored for specific operation requirements. All components at COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA."

PRISM is a government code name for a data-collection effort.The PRISM program collects stored Internet communications based on demands made to Internet companies such as Google Inc. and Apple Inc. under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to turn over any data that match court-approved search terms. The NSA can use these PRISM requests to target communications that were encrypted when they traveled across the Internet backbone, to focus on stored data that telecommunication filtering systems discarded earlier, and to get data that is easier to handle, among other things. The program is operated under the supervision of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court, or FISC) pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Documents indicate that PRISM is ""the number one source of raw intelligence used for NSA analytic reports"", and it accounts for 91% of the NSA's Internet traffic acquired under FISA section 702 authority. The leaked information came to light one day after the revelation that the FISA Court had been ordering a subsidiary of telecommunications company Verizon Communications to turn over to the NSA logs tracking all of its customers' telephone calls on an ongoing daily basis."
